	https://medium.com/@avocadi/creating-my-own-shell-for-fun-635ea0d3f7b7


=>	* Very good huge book to understand how to design and build a programm language.
	[Lexing/parsing/tokenization]			OK. Amazing Book!
	https://craftinginterpreters.com/ (read on-ine)Downloaded it, so you can write notes.

	Resume per reading chunks:
	- Today, September 4, I read until page 38. Actually, here starts what we want of this
	ook. The Map of the territory is good to read. The Lox lang is about the language and
	the choices the author made to create the lang.
	The chapter Tree-Walk Interpreter is the essence for our job. Tomorrow I gonna advance
	on it.
	- Today, September 7, I read from 38-58. Scanning process of the lox language.
	The code is in JAVA/OOP and many functions might be translated to C lang to build the
	 first steps of minishell project. Now gointo read an articcle tthat goes direct to 
	the minishell project(Minishell: Building a mini-bash (a @42 project).




=>	* https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/grr/SystemsProgrammingBook/Book/Chapter5-WritingYour
	OwnShell.pdf
	2014 Gustavo Rodriguez-Rivera and Justin Ennen,Introduction to Systems Programming:
	a Hands-on Approach. Chapter 5 			OK. Good reference. Code in C++

	How o build Command Table(tokenization) using Lex and Yacc/Bison. Use of all the stuff
	we had learn on Pipex project. dup() wait() pid() execvp() fork() etc...

	
=>	* Minishell: Building a mini-bash (a @42 project) / MannBell Jul/2023 
	https://m4nnb3ll.medium.com/minishell-building-a-mini-bash-a-42-project-b55a10598218

	- Good article that barely scraps the surface of the project letting to yu discover
	 how to do things on your own. Is more about the choices this guy face and the choices
	 he went through. I need to confess that I was expecting something more deep. For that
	, he shows is code at github. Need to look there, I imagine, that obviously, the code
	 explain it self.

=>	* Shell Simple Implementation / Oceano
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTR00r8vBH8	OK. Good basic stuff. Side docs!!!

	But, better are the side documentation that he put together: craftinterpreters book,
	many articles, and other videos with simple shells implemetations. 

	* Shell Program Explained / hhp3
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubt-UjcQUYg	OK. Useful. Also, a bit boring.

	"xv6". The video is a guy showing his program in paper sheets. 
	It hasn't most of the features we want.

	- Excelent explanation on how BASH works and a little bit of history of this programm.
	- The drawing is very illustrative about behavior of the programm.
	- Another scheme to explain the functioning could be found here:
