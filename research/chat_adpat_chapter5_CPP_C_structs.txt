Absolutely—I’m familiar with Chapter 5: “Writing Your Own Shell” from Introduction to Systems Programming: A Hands-on Approach by Gustavo Rodriguez-Rivera and Justin Ennen (2014) 
Purdue CS
Studocu
.

Here's a concise overview of what that chapter covers:

Chapter 5: Writing Your Own Shell
1. Overview

This chapter guides you through building a basic command-line shell from scratch. It's part of the book’s practical learning approach—"You really understand something until you program it." 
Purdue CS

2. Shell Structure: Parser, Executor, and Subsystems

The shell’s architecture is divided into three main components:

Parser: Reads the command line (e.g., ls -al) and builds a Command Table data structure containing parsed commands and arguments.

Executor: Carries out the commands, handling redirection, piping, background execution, and more.

Shell Subsystems: Additional features like variable expansion, command history, line editing, etc. 
Purdue CS
Studocu

3. Data Structures

The book presents C++-style struct definitions (but you can adapt them to C) for two primary constructs:

SimpleCommand
struct SimpleCommand {
  int _numberOfAvailableArguments;
  int _numberOfArguments;
  char **_arguments;
  SimpleCommand();
  void insertArgument(char *argument);
};

Command
struct Command {
  int _numberOfAvailableSimpleCommands;
  int _numberOfSimpleCommands;
  SimpleCommand **_simpleCommands;
  char *_outFile;
  char *_inputFile;
  char *_errFile;
  int _background;
  void prompt();
  void print();
  void execute();
  void clear();
  Command();
  void insertSimpleCommand(SimpleCommand *simpleCommand);
  static Command _currentCommand;
  static SimpleCommand *_currentSimpleCommand;
};
``` :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

These structures are used to accumulate parsed elements of the command line—especially handling multiple piped commands and I/O redirection.

---

### 4. **Lexing and Grammar**
The chapter walks through:
- Using **lex** (or flex) to tokenize input (`WORD`, `PIPE`, `GREAT`, etc.).
- Building tokens such as `>`, `<`, `>>`, `|`, `&`, WORD, and NEWLINE.
- Assembling parser grammar rules using **yacc (or bison)** to support command lists, arguments, pipes, I/O modifiers, background execution, and error recovery. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

### 5. **Executor Logic: Handling Pipes and Redirection**
Key steps include:
- Saving the original `stdin` and `stdout` using `dup()`.
- Iterating through each *SimpleCommand* to:
  - Set up proper `stdin` and `stdout` based on input/output redirection (`< infile`, `> outfile`) or pipe creation.
  - Fork a child process, then call `execvp()` to execute the command.
- Restore original standard I/O and wait for the last command unless it's running in the background. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

### 6. **Wildcard Expansion**
The chapter also includes logic for expanding Unix-style wildcards (`*`, `?`). It does this by:
1. Translating the wildcard pattern into a regex:
   - `*` → `.*`
   - `?` → `.`
   - Anchoring with `^` and `$`
2. Compiling the regex with `regcomp()`
3. Reading the current directory and using `regexec()` to match filenames
4. Inserting matched filenames via `strdup()` into the command's arguments :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

##  Summary Table

| Topic                        | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Parser & Lexer**          | Build an AST-like structure using lex/yacc |
| **Command Data Structures** | `SimpleCommand` and `Command` hold parsed input |
| **Executor**                | Handles redirection, piping, forking, execution |
| **Wildcard Expansion**      | Translate wildcards to regex, match filenames, expand |

You said:
Ahh, do you know if norminette from 42 school accepts a struct bigger like that one?
ChatGPT said:

Ah, nice catch 😅 You’re connecting that Command/SimpleCommand struct from the book with Norminette (the coding style checker used at 42).

Here’s the situation:

🔎 Norminette and Structs

Structs are allowed in 42 projects (you’ll see them often in minishell, push_swap, cub3d, etc.).

Size doesn’t matter for Norminette → it doesn’t care if the struct has 2 fields or 20 fields.

What Norminette checks:

Line length (max 80 chars)

Function length (max 25 lines)

File length (max ~5 functions / 5 globals)

Indentation, naming, forbidden keywords, etc.

So you can absolutely have a big struct with many members. It’s common in minishell to have a big “global” state struct (e.g. t_shell, t_command).

⚠️ What to watch for

Long struct definitions: If your struct definition itself goes beyond 25 lines, Norminette might complain (because it counts as a “function-like block”).

Global variables: Declaring a global Command _currentCommand; may trigger a Norminette warning (since globals are discouraged). Instead, pass a pointer to your struct around or wrap it in a singleton-style approach.

Naming: Norminette expects snake_case for variables/struct fields (number_of_arguments not NumberOfArguments).

✅ Typical workaround in 42

Instead of putting everything into one giant struct, students often:

Define several smaller structs:

typedef struct s_token {
    char    *value;
    int     type;
}   t_token;

typedef struct s_command {
    t_token **tokens;
    int      token_count;
    int      background;
}   t_command;

typedef struct s_shell {
    t_command  *cmds;
    int         cmd_count;
    char       *input_file;
    char       *output_file;
}   t_shell;


This way, no single struct gets “too big” in terms of line count, and it’s cleaner for Norminette.

👉 So to answer directly: Yes, Norminette accepts big structs. The only potential issue is if the struct definition itself is longer than 25 lines or violates naming/indentation rules.

Do you want me to show you how the book’s Command + SimpleCommand structs could be rewritten in 42-style (t_command, t_simple_command) to stay 100% Norminette-compliant?

You said:
The current context is that is a team work. Me and my partner in this endeavor split the job and I have the second part. Here it is:

Team mate: main/input/line_handling, lexer, parser → output AST 
Me: Expansion(including globbling), recursive execution, signal handling, built_ins

So, I need to work without having his part done. Therefore I am thinking in build a "blackbox" that give his part done and start building from there. Because that the structs to receive the data (commands, pipes, any other shit) need to be very according to the project.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect, thanks for giving me the context 👌 You’re building minishell (42 project), and you’re on the back half:

Your teammate → input → lexer → parser → AST

You → expansion (env, wildcards) → executor (recursive, pipes, redirections) → signals → builtins

Since your teammate’s parser isn’t ready yet, you want to mock a black box that outputs something equivalent to the AST / command table, so you can develop + test your side independently. That’s exactly the right approach ✅

🔑 Key idea

You need a common struct definition that both of you agree on.

Parser will fill it (from tokens/AST).

Your part will consume it (expand + execute).

So your "blackbox" just fakes that struct being filled in.

✅ Typical data structures (42 minishell style)

Here’s a simplified 42-friendly version (snake_case, smaller structs, no globals):

typedef struct s_redir
{
    char            *filename;
    int             type;   // 0: input (<), 1: output (>), 2: append (>>), 3: heredoc (<<)
    struct s_redir  *next;
}   t_redir;

typedef struct s_command
{
    char            **argv;      // ["ls", "-l", NULL]
    t_redir         *redir;      // linked list of redirections
    struct s_command *next;      // next command in a pipeline
}   t_command;

typedef struct s_pipeline
{
    t_command   *commands;   // linked list of commands connected by pipes
    int         background;  // 1 if ends with &
}   t_pipeline;

🛠 How this fits your teamwork

Your teammate (parser) will end up building something like t_pipeline *parse(char *line).

You will write functions like:

expand_pipeline(t_pipeline *pl);

execute_pipeline(t_pipeline *pl);

So you don’t need his code yet — you just write a small blackbox generator, for example:

t_pipeline *mock_pipeline(void)
{
    t_pipeline *pl = malloc(sizeof(t_pipeline));
    pl->background = 0;
    
    t_command *cmd1 = malloc(sizeof(t_command));
    cmd1->argv = (char *[]){"ls", "-l", NULL};
    cmd1->redir = NULL;
    
    t_command *cmd2 = malloc(sizeof(t_command));
    cmd2->argv = (char *[]){"grep", "42", NULL};
    cmd2->redir = NULL;
    
    cmd1->next = cmd2;
    cmd2->next = NULL;
    
    pl->commands = cmd1;
    return pl;
}


Now you can call:

t_pipeline *pl = mock_pipeline();
execute_pipeline(pl);


And later, when his parser is ready, just swap mock_pipeline() with parse(line).

⚖️ Why this works well

Keeps your work decoupled: you don’t wait for him.

Mimics the real data flow: parser → AST/struct → executor.

Norminette safe: short structs, snake_case, no globals.

Flexible: supports pipes, redirections, background jobs.

👉 Do you want me to also sketch how expansion (env + globbing) fits in this struct, so your executor only needs to handle “final argv arrays” without caring about expansion logic?

You said:
I am trying to compare this structs with those two you created based on the book... Need to understand better before send any proposition 
ChatGPT said:

Good strategy 👍 Before you propose a struct layout to your teammate, it’s smart to see how the book’s structs (the “Command” and “SimpleCommand”) compare with the 42-style version I sketched. Let’s break them down carefully:

📘 Book structs (simplified from Intro to Systems Programming)
struct SimpleCommand {
  int _numberOfAvailableArguments;
  int _numberOfArguments;
  char **_arguments;
  void insertArgument(char *argument);
};

struct Command {
  int _numberOfAvailableSimpleCommands;
  int _numberOfSimpleCommands;
  SimpleCommand **_simpleCommands;
  char *_outFile;
  char *_inputFile;
  char *_errFile;
  int _background;
  void insertSimpleCommand(SimpleCommand *simpleCommand);
};


SimpleCommand ≈ one program (ls -l) → stores its arguments.

Command ≈ a whole pipeline of SimpleCommands (e.g., ls -l | grep 42) + redirections + background flag.

🟢 My 42-style structs
typedef struct s_redir {
    char            *filename;
    int             type;   // <, >, >>, << 
    struct s_redir  *next;
}   t_redir;

typedef struct s_command {
    char            **argv;      // ["ls", "-l", NULL]
    t_redir         *redir;      // linked list of redirections
    struct s_command *next;      // next command in a pipeline
}   t_command;

typedef struct s_pipeline {
    t_command   *commands;   // linked list of commands connected by pipes
    int         background;  // 1 if ends with &
}   t_pipeline;


t_command ≈ the book’s SimpleCommand (argv only).

t_pipeline ≈ the book’s Command (pipeline + redirs + bg flag).

🔍 Key differences
Concept	Book (C++ style)	42-style (C style)
Arguments	char **_arguments inside SimpleCommand	char **argv inside t_command
Pipelines	Command holds an array of SimpleCommand *	t_pipeline has linked list of t_command
Redirections	Three separate fields: _outFile, _inFile, _errFile	General t_redir linked list (flexible, supports multiple)
Background execution	int _background in Command	int background in t_pipeline
Memory model	Dynamic arrays with insertArgument() / insertSimpleCommand()	Linked lists (simpler, 42-friendly, avoids realloc)
Naming	CamelCase + underscores (C++ style)	snake_case (argv, redir)
⚖️ Why adapt it

Book style is educational, shows how to grow arrays dynamically (good for C++/OOP thinking).

42 style is more practical for C + Norminette:

Linked lists are simpler than manual realloc.

No “methods” inside structs.

Naming conventions (t_command, argv).

👉 So structurally, they represent the same idea:

A pipeline of commands, each with arguments + redirections + flags.

The main difference is how they store them (arrays vs linked lists).

Would you like me to draw a visual diagram (boxes/arrows) showing how ls -l | grep 42 > out.txt & looks in both struct designs? That might make the comparison click instantly.

You said:
Yeah. Show me how you imagine this thing working
ChatGPT said:

Alright, let’s make it visual 🚀

Suppose the command line is:

ls -l | grep 42 > out.txt &

📘 Book’s Structs (array-based)
Command
 ├─ _simpleCommands (array of SimpleCommand*)
 │   ├─ [0] → SimpleCommand
 │   │        _arguments = ["ls", "-l", NULL]
 │   └─ [1] → SimpleCommand
 │            _arguments = ["grep", "42", NULL]
 ├─ _outFile   = "out.txt"
 ├─ _inputFile = NULL
 ├─ _errFile   = NULL
 └─ _background = 1


Command = the whole pipeline

SimpleCommand = one stage (ls -l or grep 42)

Redirections are just three fields

Pipelines are represented as an array of commands

🟢 42-style Structs (linked list)
t_pipeline
 ├─ background = 1
 └─ commands (linked list of t_command)
      ├─ t_command (for "ls -l")
      │    ├─ argv = ["ls", "-l", NULL]
      │    ├─ redir = NULL
      │    └─ next → t_command (for "grep 42")
      │
      └─ t_command (for "grep 42")
           ├─ argv = ["grep", "42", NULL]
           ├─ redir (linked list of t_redir)
           │    └─ t_redir { type = output, filename = "out.txt" }
           └─ next = NULL


t_pipeline = top-level wrapper (so you can extend later with multiple pipelines, job control, etc.)

t_command = one stage in the pipeline

Redirections handled by a linked list of t_redir (so you can have multiple, e.g., 2> err.txt 1> out.txt)

Pipelines handled by linked list of t_command instead of an array

⚖️ Practical comparison

The book version is compact, educational, but not 42-friendly:

Arrays → need dynamic resizing

Hard-coded _outFile, _inputFile, _errFile

The 42 version is flexible, modular, and Norminette-safe:

Linked lists → no realloc headaches

Redir list → supports unlimited redirections

snake_case naming

👉 Big picture:
Both designs represent the same tree:

ls -l → pipe → grep 42 → redirect stdout to out.txt → run in background.

The only difference is data layout.

Would you like me to also sketch the execution flow on top of these structs (like: expand args → set up redirs → fork/exec each command in the pipeline)? That would connect the data with your execution part.

Today 11/09/2025 Between 1200hs-1800hs

Hey, I read more stuff, watched a few videos and I still lost in this project. 

Let's go again. I need to build a blackbox to give me the commands already parsed by my classmate. This black box will be the structs holding the commands and things that my mate will parse. So I build the structs and fill them with some command line shit like you put in an example above. OK.

Next step is to do what?

I need to start to take this inputs from the structs and "expand" them into real commands and their attributes to after execute them as a built in (where I need to make functions that reproduce the command behavior) or execute them as a command shell (like ls, grep, awk, etc) only redirecting them to the path in the user/bin address and finally if in the middle of these comes a pipe I need to make this happen to.

I little bit foggy, but I think I'm growing slowly.... 

Please guide me in this quest. Also, Where To Start? oohhhh
ChatGPT said:

This is exactly the right moment to slow down, take a deep breath 😮‍💨, and lay out a roadmap.
You’re not lost — you’re at the stage where the big picture feels fuzzy because it’s big. Let’s make it clear step by step.

🗺️ Big Picture of Minishell (Your Half)
1️⃣ Input → Parser (your teammate)

Your teammate eventually gives you a t_pipeline * (or similar struct) that describes:

commands (argv)

redirections (< > >> <<)

pipes (linked commands)

background flag (&)

For now, you fake this part with a blackbox generator. ✅

2️⃣ Expansion Phase (Your First Real Task)

Take the parser output and transform it into a fully expanded set of arguments.

Things to expand:

Environment variables (echo $HOME → echo /Users/you)

Tilde expansion (~ → /home/user)

Wildcards (globbing) (*.c → file1.c file2.c)

After expansion, your argv arrays are ready for execution.

3️⃣ Execution Phase

You must run each command in the pipeline:

Redirections:

Set up input/output before running each command. (dup2(), open(), close())

Pipes:

Create pipe with pipe(fd), connect stdout of command N to stdin of command N+1.

Builtins:

If argv[0] matches a builtin (cd, echo, export, etc.), call your function directly in the parent process (no execve).

External programs:

If not builtin, fork() → execve() with argv[0] resolved through $PATH.

4️⃣ Signals & Control

Ignore Ctrl-C in parent, but allow child to receive it.

Handle Ctrl-\ properly (42 requirement).

Restore default signals in children before execve().

🛠 Step-by-Step Roadmap (Where to Start)

Here’s how I’d suggest you proceed — incremental, testable steps:

🥾 Step 0: Build the Blackbox

Make a function that returns a fake t_pipeline for testing:

t_pipeline *mock_pipeline(void);


Start with very simple cases:

One command: echo hello

Two commands piped: ls -l | wc -l

Command with redirect: cat < infile > outfile

You should be able to print the contents of the struct to confirm it looks right.

🛠 Step 1: Implement Expansion

Write:

void expand_pipeline(t_pipeline *pl);


Start small:

Implement $VAR expansion with getenv()

Implement tilde (~) expansion manually with getenv("HOME")

Implement globbing with opendir(), readdir(), and fnmatch() (or regex if you prefer)

Test: Call expand_pipeline() on your mock pipeline and print the results.

🛠 Step 2: Implement Simple Command Execution

Write a function to execute a single command (no pipes, no redirs):

void execute_command(t_command *cmd);


Steps:

Check if builtin → call builtin function

Else → fork() + execve()

Parent waits (if not background)

Test with:

echo hello
/bin/ls
env

🛠 Step 3: Add Redirections

Before running execve():

If cmd->redir contains > → open file, dup2(fd, STDOUT_FILENO)

If < → open file, dup2(fd, STDIN_FILENO)

Test with:

echo hello > file.txt
cat < file.txt

🛠 Step 4: Add Pipes

Handle multiple commands connected with |.
Algorithm:

Create a pipe for each connection

Fork for each command

Wire up dup2() so output of cmd[i] goes to input of cmd[i+1]

Test with:

ls -l | grep ".c" | wc -l

🛠 Step 5: Handle Background (&)

If pl->background is set, do not wait for the last process.

Print its PID so the user can see it’s running.

🛠 Step 6: Implement Builtins

Write functions for:

echo

cd

pwd

export

unset

env

exit

These should work without forking (except maybe echo).

🛠 Step 7: Add Signal Handling

Use signal(SIGINT, handler) to ignore Ctrl-C in parent shell

Reset default signal handlers in child before execve()

🧠 Key Advice

Focus on one step at a time.
Don’t try to make pipes + redirections + expansion work all at once.

Always test with your mock data.
Don’t wait for your teammate — by the time they deliver their parser, your executor will be rock solid.

Print, print, print.
At every stage, print your structs, argv arrays, redirections — you’ll thank yourself later.

Would you like me to draw a mini flow diagram (from “struct filled” → “expansion” → “execution” → “wait/cleanup”) so you have a visual reference on how the data flows through your code? This really helps when things start getting complicated.

🏁 Example Walkthrough (ls -l | grep 42 > out.txt &)

Mock Parser Output:
t_pipeline
→ 2 t_command linked together (ls → grep)
→ redirection list in grep → out.txt
→ background = 1

Expansion Phase:

No env vars, no wildcards here → argv unchanged

Execution Phase:

Create pipe

Fork child1 → set stdout to pipe write end → execve("ls", ["ls","-l",NULL])

Fork child2 → set stdin to pipe read end, stdout to out.txt → execve("grep", ["grep","42",NULL])

Parent doesn’t wait (background=1), just prints PIDs

Cleanup:

Close pipe ends in parent

Free memory

Return prompt

📌 Why this is helpful

You can code each block as its own function and test independently:

expand_pipeline()

execute_pipeline()

execute_command()

setup_redirections()

setup_pipes()

By isolating steps, you’ll keep the project manageable and Norminette-friendly.

Would you like me to sketch a very small “skeleton code” that wires these phases together — so you can already compile/run and print debug output before even implementing them? That way you’ll have a working scaffold to fill in.

$VAR expansion

~ expansion

wildcard expansion

Execution Phase:
Replace the print loop in execute_pipeline() with:

If one command → just fork/execve

If multiple commands → add pipes, dup2, fork for each

Add redirection support before execve

Add builtin detection (if (strcmp(cmd->argv[0], "cd") == 0) → run cd)

Memory Management:
After you’re confident, add a cleanup function to free the structs.

This approach gives you a working harness you can use right now.
When your teammate delivers the real parser, you just replace mock_pipeline() with parse_pipeline(user_input) and everything else stays the same. ✅

Would you like me to also include signal handling skeletons (ignore SIGINT in parent, reset in child) so you can drop them in later and not forget?

I'm thinking in files and folders. I need to separate this project in two. Mandatory part and bonus part. The bonus part will be the mandatory with the stuff for bonus added over it.
So I'm creating a folder:
minishell
mandatory

Yes! That’s exactly the right approach — keep mandatory and bonus physically separated so you can finish the mandatory, pass Norminette, and then layer bonus features on top without breaking what already works.

Here’s how I’d suggest structuring your project

                  |____ /mandatory
                                                  | /includes
                                                  | src
                                                  | /libft

                                              | /libft

Now, I need to start from the main as any other program I had built, but now with a fake call to the first phases of parsing and the other things. From this step I get into my black box fake machine and start to create other files to process from the simplest entry's to complex ones. However, I need to have my structure and way of coding see beyond the mandatory part being also prepared for the elements of the bonus.

Cool, good plan! You’re thinking clearly. Let me help you refine the folder structure and suggest how to organize files, so both mandatory and bonus can be maintained cleanly, and so what you build for mandatory is reusable for bonus. I’ll also pull in some norms/rules from 42 so you don’t break style.

⚙️ 42 Norm / Rules That Affect Structure

Before going into the structure, a few rules from the 42 “Norm” that will influence how you arrange your files / code:

File & directory names: only lowercase letters (a-z), digits, and underscores. No uppercase. 
s.dou.ua

Types (typedef struct ...) must start t_, struct names s_, enum e_, etc. 
s.dou.ua

Function and variable names: snake_case, lowercase, meaningful. 
s.dou.ua

Max 25 lines per function. Lines max 80 chars. 
s.dou.ua

Headers: separate .h files for function declarations, struct definitions, etc. Include guards, etc. 
s.dou.ua

Knowing these, your file/folder layout should allow compliance.

📂 Proposed Folder/File Structure

Your idea is good. Here’s a refined version, with suggestions, building on what you have:

minishell/
  ├ mandatory/
  │   ├ includes/
  │   │    ├ types.h
  │   │    ├ redir.h
  │   │    ├ command.h
  │   │    ├ builtin.h
  │   │    └ expansion.h
  │   ├ src/
  │   │    ├ main.c
  │   │    ├ prompt.c
  │   │    ├ expansion/
  │   │    │   ├ expansion_env.c
  │   │    │   ├ expansion_wildcard.c
  │   │    │   └ expansion_utils.c
  │   │    ├ executor/
  │   │    │   ├ execute_pipeline.c
  │   │    │   ├ execute_command.c
  │   │    │   └ redirection.c
  │   │    ├ builtin/

  │   │         ├ path_lookup.c
  │   │         ├ memory_helpers.c
  │   │         └ free_helpers.c
  │   ├ libft/
  │   │   └ ...  (usual libft files)
  │   ├ Makefile
  │   └ README.md
  ├ bonus/
  │   ├ includes/     (you can reuse most headers; maybe bonus_specific.h etc.)
  │   ├ src/
  │   │    ├ bonus_features/
  │   │    │    ├ logical_ops.c    (&&, ||)
  │   │    │    ├ parentheses.c
  │   │    │    └ other_bonus.c
  │   │    └ (others: reuse executor, expansion, builtin from mandatory with modifications if needed)
  │   ├ libft/
  │   ├ Makefile       (could override or extend from mandatory)
  │   └ README.md
  ├ .gitignore
  └ overall Makefile   (optional, possibly for building both)


🔁 What to Reuse / Share Between Mandatory & Bonus

To avoid duplication:

Put shared code (expansion, executor, builtin etc.) under mandatory/. Bonus should link / include / depend on that, not duplicate unless necessary.

Headers for shared parts go under mandatory/includes. Bonus includes those headers too.

If bonus needs some new utilities or changes, place them in bonus/src/bonus_features. Maybe some wrapper functions or extended behavior hooked into the shared code paths.

🚀 Workflow / Where to Start for You

Given your division of labor, here’s how I'd start using this structure:

Set up the skeleton for mandatory

Create the directories and empty skeleton files (main.c, prompt, executor stubs, expansion stubs, builtin stubs, utils).

Write headers (.h) for each logical module: command types, redirection, builtin, expansion, etc.

Implement blackbox names / mocks

In main.c, call a mock_pipeline() or something that uses your types.h structs.

Print / debug inside main or a print_pipeline() util function to verify structure.

Implement minimal mandatory features in phases

Phase A: builtins environment and path lookup (simple commands without pipes or redirection)

Phase B: redirections (<, >)

Phase C: pipes

Phase D: signals

Test thoroughly each feature. Use the mock example + maybe hardcoded inputs.

Once mandatory works, then move into bonus:

Add logical operators (&&, ||)

Parentheses

Other bonus requirements

🔍 Checkpoints & Good Practices

Keep functions short. One job per function. If a function is doing parsing + redirections + signals + builtins, break it down.

Use meaningful names. (e.g., execute_pipeline, handle_redirection, builtin_cd)

Headers should only contain what’s needed (structs, prototypes). No definitions.

Free all memory. Even if mock pipeline, set the habit of freeing.

Compose Makefile so you can build mandatory alone, and build bonus including mandatory. Maybe separate build rules.

If you like, I can prepare a concrete starter Makefile that builds mandatory and bonus targets, and maybe a template types.h and command.h you both can agree on, so you can send it to your teammate. You think that will help?

First what is stub(s)?
ChatGPT said:

A “stub” in programming is basically a placeholder — a small bit of code that stands in for a part of your program that isn’t built yet (or that you don’t want to run / depend on yet).

Here are more details + how it works in your minishell project.

📚 What a stub is, more precisely

A stub has the right interfaces (functions, structs, return types), but doesn’t do full or final behavior. Sometimes it does almost nothing or returns fixed/fake data.

It lets you compile and test parts of your program, even if other parts you depend on aren’t done. 
courses.cs.umbc.edu

It’s used a lot in development and testing – to isolate modules, to simulate behavior, to keep moving forward.

🔍 Examples of stubs

A function like:

int parse_pipeline(char *input, t_pipeline *out) {
    // real implementation not ready
    return 0; // stub just returns success without doing anything
}


Or in your case, a stub that builds a fake t_pipeline struct rather than receiving one from the parser.

🧩 Why stubs are useful for your project

You said your part of the project depends on what your teammate does (lexer/parser), but that isn’t finished yet. So:

You make a stub that stands in for “parser output”.

It builds and returns a t_pipeline * with some commands you want to test (mock pipeline).

That stub lets you start working on expansion, execution, builtins, signals, etc., without waiting for parser.

Later, when parser is ready, you replace the stub with the real parser call. Since you agreed on common structs/interfaces, everything else (your code) works unchanged.

If you like, I can write a few concrete stub examples in C for minishell (for parser, maybe for builtins) so you see how they’d look. Want me to do that?
